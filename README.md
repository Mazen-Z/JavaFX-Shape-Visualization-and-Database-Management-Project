# JavaFX Shape Visualization and Database Management Project

## **Overview**
Welcome to the JavaFX Shape Visualization and Database Management project! This  Java application seamlessly integrates two essential aspects of software engineering: interactive graphical visualization and efficient database management. This README will guide you through the intricacies of the project and its features.

## **Features**
### 1. Shape Visualization
The project showcases dynamic creation and rendering of various geometric shapes using JavaFX. Users can visualize circles, ovals, and pie charts with customizable attributes such as position, size, and color. The application provides a user-friendly interface for shape manipulation and exploration.

### 2. Geometric Calculations
Incorporating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the application performs intricate geometric calculations, including area, perimeter, and radius calculations for circles and ovals. The MyOval and MyCircle classes encapsulate these computations, demonstrating a solid understanding of mathematical concepts within a programming context.

### 3. Shape Interaction
The MyShape interface facilitates interactions between different shapes, offering methods for obtaining bounding rectangles, calculating overlapping points, and creating complex shapes from simpler ones. This modular approach ensures flexibility and extensibility for future enhancements.

## **Database Management**
The project seamlessly connects to a MySQL database, showcasing best practices in database connectivity, schema creation, and data manipulation. The StudentsDatabaseInterface, TableInterface, and StudentDatabase classes manage the creation, population, and deletion of tables with ease.

### Database Schema
The project includes a Schedule schema, representing a simplified academic schedule. The schema encompasses tables for students, courses, classes, and aggregate grades, providing a holistic view of academic data management.

## **User Interface**
The user interface is designed for ease of use and intuitive interaction. JavaFX's graphical capabilities enhance the user experience, enabling users to visualize shapes dynamically and manage database operations effortlessly.

## **Getting Started**
### Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
MySQL Database

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.
3. Set up the MySQL database with the provided connection details in the StudentDatabase.java file.
4. Run the application, and you're ready to explore the interactive shape visualization and database management features.
